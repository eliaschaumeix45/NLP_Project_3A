# NLP project - Combining Supervised and Unsupervised Methods for Keywords Extraction - ENSAE - Tom Gu√©don & Elias Chaumeix

The aim of this project is to extract keywords from a short text. For this purpose we used abstracts of research papers and the associated keywords. Our dataset is the Scielo website 3 that we scrapped. It is a Latin American website that publishes articles inEnglish shared by the Sao Paulo Research Foundation and the Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information. In this project, we chose to combine two different approaches : supervised and unsupervised learning. It seemed interesting to us because it is not usual to have access to the actual keywords of the abstracts, most of the time keywords extraction is dealt with unsupervised learning.


### Links to some of the databases we used
The following databases are to heavy to share them directly. Therefore there are the links to download if needed. However the code and outputs are already run on our GitHub notebook. 

The following link is the wikipedia database that we used in our notebook :

We took the enwiki_20180420 (window=5, iteration=10, negative=15) 100d.txt file.
